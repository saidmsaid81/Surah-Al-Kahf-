The young men presented their religion (surrender to Allah as an only One Lord) to their people, but the the latter rejected them.\n\nAllah (SWT) says what can be translated as,\n“And We made their hearts firm and strong (with the light of Faith in Allah and bestowed upon them patience to bear the separation of their kith and kin and dwellings) when they stood up and said: “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, never shall we call upon any iIlah (god) other than Him; if we did, we should indeed have uttered an enormity in disbelief.These our people have taken for worship illah (gods) other than Him (Allah). Why do they not bring for them a clear authority? And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah… but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (TMQ, 18:14-15).\n\nThe young men began to call people to Allah (SWT), but they were denied and oppressed. Thus, Allah (SWT) inspired them to seek refuge in the Cave. Allah (SWT) says what can be translated as,\n\n“…then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will open a way for you from His Mercy and will make easy for you your affair (i.e. will give you what you will need of provision, dwelling)… but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (TMQ, 18:16).\n\n Allah (SWT) supported them with great miracles: they dwelled in the cave for “three hundred (solar) years, adding nine (for lunar years)” (TMQ, 18:25). Allah (SWT) says what can be translated as,\n\n“…And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left,while they lay in the midst of the Cave…but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (TMQ, 18:17).\n\n“And you would have thought them awake, whereas they were asleep. And We turned them on their right and on their left sides…” (TMQ, 18: 18).\n\nAll of these miracles were accomplished for the sake of protecting these young men. In fact, they awoke 309 years later to find that the people around them had become believers and that they were now part of a new society, filled with faith.\n\nSent from Surah Al Kahf android App Link to app', null,null,'goo.gl/LAhqoF');return false"><i class="zmdi zmdi-share"></i></a>

<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Allah (SWT) says what can be translated as,&nbsp;</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“And We made their hearts firm and strong (with the light of Faith in Allah and bestowed upon them patience to bear the separation of their kith and kin and dwellings) when they stood up and said: “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, never shall we call upon any iIlah (god) other than Him; if we did, we should indeed have uttered an enormity in disbelief.These our people have taken for worship illah (gods) other than Him (Allah). Why do they not bring for them a clear authority? And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah… but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (TMQ, 18:14-15).</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></b>
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;The young men began to call people to Allah (SWT), but they were denied and oppressed. Thus, Allah (SWT) inspired them to seek refuge in the Cave. Allah (SWT) says what can be translated as,&nbsp;

</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></b>
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“…then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will open a way for you from His Mercy and will make easy for you your affair (i.e. will give you what you will need of provision, dwelling)… but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (TMQ, 18:16).</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></b>
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;Allah (SWT) supported them with great miracles: they dwelled in the cave for “three hundred (solar) years, adding nine (for lunar years)” (TMQ, 18:25). Allah (SWT) says what can be translated as,</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></b>
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;“…And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the midst of the Cave…but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (TMQ, 18:17).&nbsp;</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></b>
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;“And you would have thought them awake, whereas they were asleep. And We turned them on their right and on their left sides…” (TMQ, 18: 18).</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></b>
<b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;All of these miracles were accomplished for the sake of protecting these young men. In fact, they awoke 309 years later to find that the people around them had become believers and that they were now part of a new society, filled with faith.</span></b>

<h3>The Story of Musa and Al-Khidr </h3> 
<a href="#" onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('The Story of Musa And Al-Khidr\n\nThe third story is that of Prophet Musa (AS) and Al-Khidr. Prophet Musa (AS) was asked by his people about who was the most knowledgeable on earth. Prophet Musa (AS) replied that he himself was. He thought that he had enough knowledge to earn that title, especially because he was one of Allah’s favored Prophets. However, Allah (SWT) revealed to him that there was a learned man elsewhere. For this reason, He commanded him (AS) to go to where the two seas met. Musa (AS), accompanied by a boy servant, traveled a great distance until he was overcome by fatigue. He then told his servant, “Truly, we have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey” (TMQ, 18:62).\n\nHe was extremely exhausted by the time he met up with the righteous and more knowing man. The type of knowledge that man had is in fact the trust in Allah’s predestination: the way Allah predetermines and arranges the course of events in life. There is also wisdom in Allah’s predestination which makes necessary for one to know for certain that Allah alone handles life matters. This knowledge, in short, is learning how to know Allah (SWT) in the correct way in so far as His handling of life matters is concerned.\n\nBefore Prophet Musa (AS) could accompany Al-Khidr on his journey, the latter set forth a few conditions. Allah (SWT) says what can be translated as, “Ask me not about anything till I myself mention of it to you… but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (TMQ, 18:70). Prophet Musa (AS) replied, “If Allah wills, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in aught” (TMQ, 18:69).\n\nThe trip was marked by three incidents which seem very negative or malicious at first glance:\n\n1- The ship Al-Khidr pierced because there was an unjust king who was taking away every ship by force.\n2- The child Al-Khidr killed because he was not dutiful towards his parents who were righteous. His disobedience caused them too much trouble.\n3- The wall Al-Khidr rebuilt because it was damaged in part, without recompense for his work especially in a town he wasn’t warmly welcomed. In fact, a treasure belonging to two orphan boys was buried beneath it. It would have been stolen had he (Al Khidr) not built the wall.\n\nAllah’s wisdom seems to be not apparent at first glance in the way the three above-cited incidents are arranged; Al-Khidr’s acts seem not to be justified. This is to prove to the believers that Allah (SWT) may handle matters in ways we may not understand. Consequently, we may neither grasp the wisdom behind this nor appreciate the goodness or the positive effects this may have on our life. This is the type of knowledge, not found in any book, that Allah (SWT) wishes to teach not only to Prophet Musa (AS) but to us as well.\n\nSent from Surah Al Kahf android App Link to app', null,null,'goo.gl/LAhqoF');return false"><i class="zmdi zmdi-share"></i></a>

<h3>Benefits of reciting Surah Al kahf </h3> 
<a href="#" onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('In shaa Allah, you will get in the habit of reading Suratul Kahf every Friday. You can begin on Thursday evening as it is technically \'the night of Friday\' once Maghrib has arrived.\nSomething to make it easier is to read along with a well-known reciter.\n\nSuratul Kahf Makkan Surah\n18th Surah in the Qur\'an\nIt\'s ayat number 110\n\nPreferences of the Surah\nThere are many ahadeeth that enumerate the blessings of this surah in its entirety and regarding the first or last ten ayat.\n\n\n1.From Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, who said: “Whoever reads Soorat al-Kahf on the night of Jumu’ah, will have a light that will stretch between him and the Ancient House (the Ka’bah).” \n(Narrated by al-Daarimi, 3407. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani inSaheeh al-Jaami, 6471) \n\n2. “Whoever reads Soorat al-Kahf on the day of Jumu’ah, will have a light that will shine from him from one Friday to the next.” \n\n(Narrated by al-Haakim, 2\/399; al-Bayhaqi, 3\/249. Ibn Hajar said in Takhreej al-Adhkaar that this is a hasan hadeeth, and he said, this is the strongest report that has been narrated concerning readingSoorat al-Kahf. See: Fayd al-Qadeer, 6\/198. It was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani inSaheeh al-Jaami’, 6470) \n\n3.It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever reads Soorat al-Kahf on the day of Jumu’ah, a light will shine for him from beneath his feet to the clouds of the sky, which will shine for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be forgiven (his sins) between the two Fridays.’” \n\nAl-Mundhiri said, this was narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Mardawayh in his Tafseer, with an isnaad with which there was nothing wrong. \n\n(al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 1\/298) \n\n4.narrated by Muslim from al-Nawwaas ibn Sam’aan, in which it says: “Whoever among you sees him (the Dajjaal), let him recite against him the opening verses of Soorat al-Kahf.”  (Hadeeth 5228).\n\n5.Muslim (no. 1342) narrated from Abu’l-Dardaa’ that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever memorizes ten aayaat from the beginning of Soorat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjaal” – i.e., from his fitnah. Muslim said: “Shu’bah said, ‘from the end of al-Kahf.’ Hammaam said, ‘from the beginning of al-Kahf.’”\n\nAl-Nawawi said: “The reason for this is because at the beginning of (this soorah), mention is made of wonders and signs, and whoever ponders them will not be deceived by the fitnah of the Dajjaal. And at the end of this soorah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My slaves as awliyaa’ (lords etc.) besides Me?’ [al-Kahf 18:102].” (Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 6\/93).\n\nUndoubtedly Soorat al-Kahf is of great significance, containing great aayaat, such as the story of the People of the Cave, the story of Moosa and al-Khidr, the story of Dhu’l-Qarnayn and his building the dam to hold back Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj, proof of the resurrection and the blowing of the Trumpet, and explanation of those whose deeds are most lost, who are those who think that they are guided when in fact they are misguided and blind. \n\nEvery Muslim should strive to read this soorah, and to memorize it and read it repeatedly, especially on the best day on which the sun rises, namely Friday\n\nSent from Surah Al Kahf android App Link to app', null,null,'goo.gl/LAhqoF');return false"><i class="zmdi zmdi-share"></i></a>

<b>═✦════✦SECRETS OF SURAH AL-KAHF✦════✦═<br /><br />Ever wondered why Prophet Muhammad(SAW) asked us to recite Surat Al-Kahf every Friday?<br />Let’s ﬁnd out today inshaAllah…<br /><br />This Surah has Four stories in it,having some morals,lets see them and understand what they are saying to us:<br /><br /><br />1) The People Of The Cave<br />Its the story of young men who lived in a disbelieving town, so they decided to migrate for the sake of Allah and run away. -Allah rewards them with mercy in the cave and protection from the sun - They woke up and found the entire village believers.<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF FAITH.<br /><br />2) The Owner Of Two Gardens<br />A story of a man whom Allah blessed with two beautiful gardens, but the man forgot to thank the One who blessed him with everything and he even dared to doubt Allah regarding the afterlife.So His garden was destroyed - He regretted ,but was too late and his regret did not beneﬁt him .<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF WEALTH.<br /><br />3) Musa(AS) and Khidr(AS)<br />When Musa(AS) was asked-“Who’s the most knowledgeable of the people of earth?”” Musa(AS) said:Me…,but Allah revealed to him that there’s someone who Knows more than him.Musa(AS) traveled to the man and learnt how the Divine Wisdom can sometimes be hidden in matters which we perceive as bad.<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF KNOWLEDGE.<br /><br />4) Dhul-Qarnayn<br />Its a story of the great King that was given knowledge and power and was going around the world,helping people and spreading all that’s good.He was able to overcome the problem of Yajooj-Majooj and build a massive dam with the help of people whom he could not even understand.<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF POWER.<br /><br />In the middle Allah mentions Iblees as the one who stirs these trials:</b></div>
