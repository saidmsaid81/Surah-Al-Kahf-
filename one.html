<h3>The Story of Musa and Al-Khidr </h3> 
<a href="#" onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('The Story of Musa And Al-Khidr\n\nThe third story is that of Prophet Musa عليه السلام and Al-Khidr. Prophet Musa عليه السلام was asked by his people about who was the most knowledgeable on earth. Prophet Musa عليه السلام replied that he himself was. He thought that he had enough knowledge to earn that title, especially because he was one of Allah’s favored Prophets. However, Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) revealed to him that there was a learned man elsewhere. For this reason, He commanded him عليه السلام to go to where the two seas met. Musa عليه السلام, accompanied by a boy servant, traveled a great distance until he was overcome by fatigue. He then told his servant, “Truly, we have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey” (Quran, 18:62).\n\nHe was extremely exhausted by the time he met up with the righteous and more knowing man. The type of knowledge that man had is in fact the trust in Allah’s predestination: the way Allah predetermines and arranges the course of events in life. There is also wisdom in Allah’s predestination which makes necessary for one to know for certain that Allah alone handles life matters. This knowledge, in short, is learning how to know Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) in the correct way in so far as His handling of life matters is concerned.\n\nBefore Prophet Musa عليه السلام could accompany Al-Khidr on his journey, the latter set forth a few conditions. Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) says what can be translated as, “Ask me not about anything till I myself mention of it to you… but no one knows its true meanings except Allah” (Quran, 18:70). Prophet Musa عليه السلام replied, “If Allah wills, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in aught” (Quran, 18:69).\n\nThe trip was marked by three incidents which seem very negative or malicious at first glance:\n\n1- The ship Al-Khidr pierced because there was an unjust king who was taking away every ship by force.\n2- The child Al-Khidr killed because he was not dutiful towards his parents who were righteous. His disobedience caused them too much trouble.\n3- The wall Al-Khidr rebuilt because it was damaged in part, without recompense for his work especially in a town he wasn’t warmly welcomed. In fact, a treasure belonging to two orphan boys was buried beneath it. It would have been stolen had he (Al Khidr) not built the wall.\n\nAllah’s wisdom seems to be not apparent at first glance in the way the three above-cited incidents are arranged; Al-Khidr’s acts seem not to be justified. This is to prove to the believers that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) may handle matters in ways we may not understand. Consequently, we may neither grasp the wisdom behind this nor appreciate the goodness or the positive effects this may have on our life. This is the type of knowledge, not found in any book, that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) wishes to teach not only to Prophet Musa عليه السلام but to us as well.\n\nSent from Surah Al Kahf android App Link to app', null,null,'goo.gl/LAhqoF');return false"><i class="zmdi zmdi-share"></i></a>

<b>═✦════✦SECRETS OF SURAH AL-KAHF✦════✦═<br /><br />Ever wondered why Prophet Muhammadﷺ asked us to recite Surat Al-Kahf every Friday?<br />Let’s ﬁnd out today inshaAllah…<br /><br />This Surah has Four stories in it,having some morals,lets see them and understand what they are saying to us:<br /><br /><br />1) The People Of The Cave<br />Its the story of young men who lived in a disbelieving town, so they decided to migrate for the sake of Allah and run away. -Allah rewards them with mercy in the cave and protection from the sun - They woke up and found the entire village believers.<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF FAITH.<br /><br />2) The Owner Of Two Gardens<br />A story of a man whom Allah blessed with two beautiful gardens, but the man forgot to thank the One who blessed him with everything and he even dared to doubt Allah regarding the afterlife.So His garden was destroyed - He regretted ,but was too late and his regret did not beneﬁt him .<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF WEALTH.<br /><br />3) Musaعليه السلام and Khidrعليه السلام<br />When Musaعليه السلام was asked-“Who’s the most knowledgeable of the people of earth?”” Musaعليه السلام said:Me…,but Allah revealed to him that there’s someone who Knows more than him.Musaعليه السلام traveled to the man and learnt how the Divine Wisdom can sometimes be hidden in matters which we perceive as bad.<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF KNOWLEDGE.<br /><br />4) Dhul-Qarnayn<br />Its a story of the great King that was given knowledge and power and was going around the world,helping people and spreading all that’s good.He was able to overcome the problem of Yajooj-Majooj and build a massive dam with the help of people whom he could not even understand.<br />MORAL:TRIAL OF POWER.<br /><br />In the middle Allah mentions Iblees as the one who stirs these trials:</b></div>

<h3>Etiquettes of saying InShaAllah </h3> 
<a href="#" onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Etiquettes of saying InShaAllah\nThe Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his Ummah has been taught to say \'InshaAllah\' ( إن شاء الله ) along with the promise or affirmation of doing something in the future. Because, who knows if one does or does not live, and even if one does, will one be able to do or not to do that? \n\nلَا تَقُولَنَّ لِشَا۟ىْءٍ إِنِّى فَاعِلٌ ذَٰلِكَ غَدًا ﴿٢٣﴾ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّـهُ ۚ وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ إِذَا نَسِيتَ وَقُلْ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَهْدِيَنِ رَبِّى لِأَقْرَبَ مِنْ هَـٰذَا رَشَدًا ﴿٢٤\n\nAnd never say of anything, \'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,\' (23) Except [when adding], \'If Allah wills.\' And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, \'Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct.\' (24)\n[Qur\'an Al-Kahf 18:23-24]\n\nThe background of the revelation of the first two verses has been reported in Lubab from Sayyidna \'Abdullah ibn \'Abbas in the following manner. When the people of Makkah acting as coached by the Jews, asked the Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him peace, about the story of Ashab al-Kahf etc., he promised to answer that next day without having said InshaAllah. The least shortcoming issuing forth from the close ones brings some or the other notice of caution. Therefore, no revelation came for the next fifteen days. Naturally, the Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him peace, was grieved and the Mushriks of Makkah had their opportunity to laugh and ridicule.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his Ummah has been taught to say 'InshaAllah' ( إن شاء الله ) along with the promise or affirmation of doing something in the future. Because, who knows if one does or does not live, and even if one does, will one be able to do or not to do that?&nbsp;</b></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>لَا تَقُولَنَّ لِشَا۟ىْءٍ إِنِّى فَاعِلٌ ذَٰلِكَ غَدًا ﴿٢٣﴾ إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّـهُ ۚ وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ إِذَا نَسِيتَ وَقُلْ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَهْدِيَنِ رَبِّى لِأَقْرَبَ مِنْ هَـٰذَا رَشَدًا ﴿٢٤</b></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow," (23) Except [when adding], "If Allah wills." And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct." (24)</b></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>The background of the revelation of the first two verses has been reported in Lubab from Sayyidna 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas in the following manner. When the people of Makkah acting as coached by the Jews, asked the Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him peace, about the story of Ashab al-Kahf etc., he promised to answer that next day without having said InshaAllah. The least shortcoming issuing forth from the close ones brings some or the other notice of caution. Therefore, no revelation came for the next fifteen days.
